Analysis macros for FRIB
========================

These macros have been written to determine the energy spectrum,
the reconstructed position and the cluster size of
alpha particles interacting in a drift chamber for the S800 spectrometer
(https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/15/03/P03025).

It is important to note, that these macros plot both,
the full spectrum of all interactions, as well as the ones with a trigger
signal generated by an alpha particle interacting in a SiPIN detector
positioned the drift chamber.

Run the macros with the following command:
```bash
root -b -q MACRONAME.cpp
```
